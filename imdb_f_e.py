"""
1. **Pandas:** Used as the main data processing library in the project. 
Movie and user rating data were loaded, cleaned, and processed from the IMDb dataset. 
Specifically, I utilized Pandas functions like `groupby` and `pivot_table` to extract 
title and year information, remove missing values, and create group-based summary statistics. 
Additionally, I worked with pivot tables to build the user-movie matrix, which forms the foundation 
of the recommendation algorithm.

2. **NumPy:** Used for the numerical operations underlying Pandas and especially to provide data 
to the `cosine_similarity` function. The NumPy array structure was employed to efficiently store 
large data matrices and to perform mathematical operations quickly.

3. **unicodedata:** Since movie titles can contain various characters and accents, Unicode normalization 
was applied to ensure consistency in title comparisons. This made it easier to match titles like 
‚ÄúAm√©lie‚Äù containing special characters with their simplified versions such as ‚ÄúAmelie‚Äù.

4. **difflib:** Movie names entered by users may not exactly match those in the dataset. Therefore, 
I used the `get_close_matches` function to find the closest matching movie titles for the input. 
This approach helped find the correct movie even if there were missing letters or minor spelling errors, 
thus improving user experience.

5. **scikit-learn (cosine_similarity):** Cosine similarity was used to calculate similarity between vectors 
representing user ratings of movies. This method numerically expresses whether two movies were rated similarly 
by users and forms the core of the recommendation algorithm. Consequently, movies with high similarity scores 
are recommended to each other.

6. **colorama:** Used to produce colored outputs during command-line user interaction. Success messages, 
warnings, error messages, and informational notes were displayed in different colors to enhance readability 
and user experience. This was especially helpful for users to easily distinguish recommendation lists and error messages.

"""
"""
* **Data Source:** The dataset was obtained from the GroupLens website.
* **Story:** We researched all CSV-format IMDb and MovieLens datasets and finally **merged 6 different datasets** into a single CSV file.
* **Project Objective:** By processing user and movie data, calculate **IMDb weighted scores (`IMDB_SCORE`)** and, based on these scores:

  * Recommend similar movies by title
  * Provide recommendations based on a user‚Äôs watch history
  * List the top movies of a specific year
  * Recommend the best movies by genre
    This allows for **score-based year and genre recommendations**.
* **Number of Records:** \~26,000,000
* **Size:** \~1.8 GB
* **Data Content:** User‚Äìmovie ratings and movie metadata
* **Columns:**

  * **USERID:** User ID
  * **TITLE:** Movie title and year
  * **YEAR:** Release year
  * **GENRES:** Movie genres
  * **RATING:** Rating out of 5
  * **RATING\_10:** Rating normalized to a 10-point scale
  * **TIME:** Rating date
  * **NUM\_VOTES:** Total number of votes
  * **IMDB\_SCORE:** Weighted IMDb score
